<h1>The Best Movie According to Duya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Avatar The Way of Water</h3>
<p>I watch the movie on IMAX with 3D format, so it's giving a really good watching experience. The graphic is very good.</p>

<h3>The Wolf Children</h3>
<p>Stuck in my head for some time, good anime, the story line is not going as i wanted, but still love it.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Also not going as i wanted. Like why? I want them to be together</p>
